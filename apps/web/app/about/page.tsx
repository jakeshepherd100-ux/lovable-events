          I live in San Diego and spend a lot of time building with AI, thinking about startups,
          and trying to connect with people doing the same. The problem: the best events are
          scattered across Luma, Eventbrite, Meetup, and a dozen Slack groups. I was always
          finding out about things too late.
        </p>

          So I started keeping a list. This site is that list, made public.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on events worth your time — AI builder meetups, founder demo nights, funding
          panels, and the occasional online event that's good enough to open a browser tab for.
          Mostly San Diego. Sometimes global, when something is genuinely worth it.

          If you know of an event that should be here, reach out.
